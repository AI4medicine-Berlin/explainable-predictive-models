# Framework for predictive modelling on tabular datasets with xAI

This repository contains the implementation and evaluation of traditional (GLM, Lasso and Elastic Net) and non-traditional (Tree Boosting, SVM, Naive Bayes and Multilayer Perceptron) machine learning algorithms for classification. 
Additionally, for each computed model explanations (Shapley values for all, weights for GLM, Taylor Decomposition for MLP) are calculated and visualized. 
Classification performance is evaluated using 10 different measures.
